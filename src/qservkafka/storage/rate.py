class RateLimitStore:
    """Storage for tracking concurrent queries for rate limiting.

    This approach to rate limiting is not robust against race conditions due
    to a few problems:

    #. The bridge may lose contact with Redis after query completion and may
       not be able to decrement the counter properly.
    #. The bridge may increment the counter and then die before starting the
       query or decrementing it again.
    #. arq may re-run a result handling job in a way that causes us to
       decrement the counter for a user twice.

    Rather than trying to make the system fully robust, which seems complex,
    these races are addressed by attempting self-healing to eventually restore
    consistency. The caller should periodically count all running queries by
    other means and then call `reconcile_query_counts`. This will reset each
    counter to the counted number of queries in progress, as long as that
    count is less than the current count, and also set the counter to zero if
    it is negative.

    Parameters
    ----------
    redis
        A Redis client configured to talk to the backend store.
