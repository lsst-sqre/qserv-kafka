### New features

- Use [Repertoire](https://repertoire.lsst.io/) service discovery to find the DataLink service and rewrite URLs flagged for rewriting to point to the local DataLink URL, preserving the query parameters. Only support using the URL rewrite flag to rewrite DataLink URLs, which was the only thing it had been used for.
