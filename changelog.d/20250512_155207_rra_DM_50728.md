### Bug fixes

- Use a buffering strategy in the VOTable BINARY2 encoder to simplify the async generator stack and avoid creating as many small objects that have to be garbage-collected. Accumulate roughly 64KB of encoded data before writing to the upload URL to reduce the number of small writes. These changes produced roughly a 2x performance improvement in encoding.
