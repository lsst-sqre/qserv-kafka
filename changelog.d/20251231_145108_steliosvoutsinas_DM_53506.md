### New features

- Add support for Google BigQuery as a database backend using its REST API. The database backend, either BigQuery (new) or Qsev (existing), is selected via the new `backend` query parameter.

### Other changes

- Split the `query_success` metrics event into backend-specific events (`qserv_success` and `bigquery_success`). Both use generic field names (`backend_elapsed`, `backend_size`, `backend_rate`) for backend timing and size metrics.
- Split the protocol failure metrics event into `qserv_failure` and `bigquery_failure`.
