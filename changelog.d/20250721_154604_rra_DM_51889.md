### Bug fixes

- Increase termination grace period for arq workers and shield closing the database query results. This hopefully will fix an issue where arq's attempt to cancel a timed-out task converted the cancellation exception to a SQL exception, which triggered a retry of the query in one worker while simultaneously processing the query in a second worker.
