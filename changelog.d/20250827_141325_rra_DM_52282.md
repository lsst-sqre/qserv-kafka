### New features

- Add a new configuration setting, `redis_max_connections`, to tune the size of the Redis connection pool.
- Add a new configuration setting, `job_run_max_bytes`, to increase the size of a batch the bridge will read from Kafka at one time.

### Bug fixes

- Change the default for `max_worker_jobs` to 2, matching the Phalanx configuration. Because worker jobs are CPU-bound, there's rarely a reason to increase the number of jobs per worker higher than this.
- Changed the defaults for the Qserv database connection pool and REST connection pool to align with the default for the message batch size.
