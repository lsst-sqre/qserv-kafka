### Bug fixes

- When formatting `char` fields in VOTable results, convert column `datetime` types to the ISO 8601 string representation required by the IVOA DALI standard. Previously, such fields were serialized using the Python `str` value of `datetime`, which does not match the expected IVOA format.
